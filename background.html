                <h2>What Are Piezoelectric Cells?</h2>
                <p>Piezoelectric cells are materials that generate an electrical charge in response to mechanical stress. This phenomenon occurs in a variety of crystalline materials such as quartz and some ceramics. These materials are widely used in sensors, actuators, and energy harvesting systems.</p>

                <h2>History of Piezoelectricity</h2>
                <p>The piezoelectric effect was first discovered by Pierre and Jacques Curie in 1880. Since then, it has been used in various technologies like sonar equipment, medical ultrasound devices, and most recently, in energy harvesting systems to power small electronic devices.</p>

                <h2>How Piezoelectric Cells Work</h2>
                <p>Piezoelectric cells work by converting mechanical stress (like pressure or vibrations) into electrical energy. This process occurs because the internal structure of piezoelectric materials aligns their dipoles when stress is applied, causing an electric potential to develop across the material. This potential can then be harvested as electrical power.</p>

                <h2>Potential for Sustainable Energy</h2>
                <p>As the global focus shifts towards renewable and sustainable energy solutions, piezoelectric cells offer an innovative way to generate electricity from everyday movements. By embedding piezoelectric cells in floors, roads, and other infrastructure, the kinetic energy of human or vehicular activity can be harnessed to power small devices or streetlights.</p>

    <div id="moreInfo" style="display: none; margin-top: 10px;">
        <p> In today’s day and age, there is a drastic increase in the rate at which we are consuming fossil fuels,
            increasing the rate of depletion. This in turn is causing issues, such as power outages. 
            A study by the U.S. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) found that power outages caused by fuel supply issues 
            increased by 23% between 2016 and 2020. Though the supply of fossil fuels is decreasing, the demand for energy is not 
            going down. This is due to the increasing population. This is causing a huge strain on the world's resources and 
            causing fossil fuels to become more expensive. This is the main reason why power grids and plants are facing greater 
            challenges in maintaining consistent energy output, leading to more frequent power outages. This slight shift to use 
            piezoelectric cells to generate electricity for daily necessary and important purposes such as streetlights, and 
            traffic lights would contribute to reducing not only the dependency but also the harmful effects that non-renewable 
            energy sources have on the environment.</p>
        <p>Piezoelectricity gives us the opportunity to use human activity (mechanical stress)—such as walking on sidewalks and vehicles passing over roads to be converted into electrical energy that can be used to power streetlights and traffic lights, this force generated by the humans is wasted mechanical energy, therefore using these cells will be energy efficient, as we are putting the wasted energy to use to generate sustainable and reliable energy supplies which are a good alternative to non renewable energy. Piezoelectric cells can be embedded beneath the road or footpath surfaces at walkways to capture the energy from the mechanical stress created by the pedestrian footsteps and vehicles. This mechanical energy would then be converted into electrical energy, which can be used to power streetlights, traffic lights, billboards etc. This also provides a consistent renewable energy source, which reduces the dependency on non-renewable energy sources. This consistent supply of energy ensures that if there is a power outage energy is still supplied. In India, the majority of nighttime fatalities occur at night. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, around 40% of accidents occur at night,due to inadequate lighting. Moreover, properly lit street lighting reduces the chances for nighttime accidents. Additionally, malfunctioning traffic or street lights potentially can cause confusion,  not only amongst pedestrians but also between vehicles, with studies showing that approximately 2% of all urban crashes are directly linked to traffic signal failures. By using these piezoelectric cells, you can ensure a long-term supply of consistent and reliable power supply, which can significantly reduce these risks and make urban environments safer for pedestrians and drivers both.  Piezoelectric cells have a lifespan of over 15 years, making them a durable and low-maintenance option for sustainable energy solutions.
</p>
        <p> In case of fluctuations, hybrid systems can be implemented, combining piezoelectric cells with other renewable energy sources such as solar can create a more consistent power supply, additionally we can implement energy storage systems which can store excess energy generated during peak traffic hours to ensure a reliable supply of energy even during low traffic time periods. It is necessary to invest in research and development to develop more efficient piezoelectric materials or technologies that can enhance energy conversion rates. We can also integrate piezoelectric cells into existing infrastructure (by embedding them into sidewalks, roadways or bridges) to increase their functionality and power generation.
